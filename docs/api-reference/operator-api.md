| Field | Description | Default | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `minReplicas` _integer_ | MinReplicas is the lower limit for the number of replicas for the target resource.<br />It will be used by the horizontal pod autoscaler to determine the minimum number of replicas to scale-in to. |  |  |
| `maxReplicas` _integer_ | maxReplicas is the upper limit for the number of replicas to which the autoscaler can scale up.<br />It cannot be less that minReplicas. |  |  |

The desired replica count is calculated multiplying the<br />ratio between the target value and the current value by the current<br />number of pods.  Ergo, metrics used must decrease as the pod count is<br />increased, and vice versa.  See the individual metric source types for<br />more information about how each type of metric must respond.<br />If not set, the default metric will be set to 80% average CPU utilization. |  |  |

For auto update strategies where Grove handles the orchestration, while the update is<br />still in progress it will be nil, and will be set once the update finishes where all Pods are replaced by Grove with<br />the latest specification. For the OnDelete strategy, it is set to the same time as UpdateStartedAt, which implies<br />that there is no work pending on Grove. As can be observed with the OnDelete strategy, UpdateEndedAt being set does<br />not necessarily mean that all Pods are running with the latest specifications. |  |  |
| `podCliqueSetGenerationHash` _string_ | PodCliqueSetGenerationHash is the generation hash corresponding to the latest PodCliqueSet spec that this<br />PodClique should converge to. PodCliqueStatus.CurrentPodCliqueSetGenerationHash is set to this hash once<br />UpdateEndedAt is set, which marks the end of the update. |  |  |
| `podTemplateHash` _string_ | PodTemplateHash is the template hash of the PodClique that the Pods of this PodClique should converge to.<br />This hash is used to segregate Pods which are up to date with the specification, and ones which are outdated for<br />preferential deletions in auto update strategies, and in all strategies for scale-ins.<br />PodCliqueStatus.PodTemplateHash is set to this hash once UpdateEndedAt is set, which marks the end of the update. |  |  |
| `readyPodsSelectedToUpdate` _[PodsSelectedToUpdate](#podsselectedtoupdate)_ | ReadyPodsSelectedToUpdate captures the pod names of ready Pods that are either currently being updated or have<br />been previously updated. This field is only set for auto update strategies where Grove orchestrates Pod deletions.<br />For the OnDelete strategy this field is not set, because Pod replacement is initiated by user-driven Pod deletions. |  |  |


#### PodGangEntry



PodGangEntry describes one scheduling batch, identified by its epoch, that materializes into one
or more PodGangs. An Anchor entry materializes into a single anchor PodGang; a Tail or ScaleOut
entry materializes into one PodGang per (PodCliqueScalingGroup, replica index) it carries.



_Appears in:_
- [PodGangMapSpec](#podgangmapspec)

| Field | Description | Default | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `epoch` _string_ | Epoch is the identity of this entry and the group of PodGangs materialized from it. It serves<br />two purposes.<br />  - Identity: it is unique across entries within a PodGangMap and is the listMapKey. Every<br />    PodGang materialized from this entry carries it as the grove.io/epoch label, so those<br />    PodGangs are grouped by it.<br />  - Ordering: DependsOn references epochs, and comparing epochs orders entries so scheduling<br />    dependencies can be expressed and the most recent anchor found.<br />The value is a monotonic unix-nano integer used only as a distinct, orderable key. It is not<br />interpreted as a wall-clock time. |  |  |
| `podCliqueSetGenerationHash` _string_ | PodCliqueSetGenerationHash is the PodCliqueSet generation hash that pods in this PodGang<br />must match. Used by PodClique and PodCliqueScalingGroup reconcilers to create pods at the<br />correct spec version and to distinguish old pods from new pods during a coherent update. |  |  |

Index 0 marks the anchor that carries the<br />MinAvailable replicas. It orders the anchors of a generation hash independently of the global<br />epoch order, so the MinAvailable anchor stays identifiable as more anchors are added.<br />NOTE: today a PodCliqueSet replica has a single anchor with index 0. Coherent updates (GREP-393)<br />introduce additional anchors per hash with higher indices. |  |  |
| `podCliques` _object (keys:string, values:integer)_ | PodCliques maps standalone PodClique name to the number of pods that belong to this PodGang.<br />Only standalone PodCliques (not owned by a PodCliqueScalingGroup) are listed here.<br />PodCliques owned by a PodCliqueScalingGroup derive their PodGang association via<br />PCSGReplicaIndices below. |  |  |
| `pcsgReplicaIndices` _object (keys:string, values:integer array)_ | PCSGReplicaIndices maps a PodCliqueScalingGroup config name to the PCSG replica indices this<br />entry carries. For a non-anchor entry the PodGang materializer expands these into one PodGang<br />per index. Indices are stable identities that survive entry reshuffles, so a PodClique<br />reconciler for a PodCliqueScalingGroup-owned PodClique can find its target PodGang by looking<br />up its replica index here. |  |  |
| `dependsOn` _string array_ | DependsOn lists the epochs whose PodGangs must be scheduled before this entry's PodGang<br />becomes eligible for scheduling. An empty DependsOn means the entry has no scheduling<br />dependency and its PodGang is eligible for scheduling immediately. |  |  |

| `Tail` | PodGangEntryRoleTail marks a non-anchor entry that holds a PodCliqueScalingGroup's replica<br />indices above MinAvailable, as declared by the template. It materializes into one PodGang per<br />replica index.<br /> |
| `ScaleOut` | PodGangEntryRoleScaleOut marks the entry that holds PodCliqueScalingGroup replicas added by a<br />steady-state scale-out beyond the template. It materializes into one PodGang per replica index.<br />The entry is created for every PodCliqueSet that has a PodCliqueScalingGroup, starting empty, and<br />is kept even when empty for the current generation. It offers a stable scale-out epoch that<br />downstream reconcilers use when independently constructing PodGang names.<br /> |

#### UpdateStrategyType

_Underlying type:_ _string_

UpdateStrategyType defines the type of update strategy for PodCliqueSet.

_Validation:_
- Enum: [RollingRecreate OnDelete]

_Appears in:_
- [PodCliqueSetUpdateStrategy](#podcliquesetupdatestrategy)

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Coherent` | CoherentStrategy indicates that replicas will be updated in Minimal Viable Units —<br />MinAvailable replicas of each updated standalone PodClique plus MinAvailable replicas of each<br />updated PodCliqueScalingGroup — scheduled atomically as a new PodGang. This guarantees<br />that pods forming a minimum-viable serving unit are always version-compatible.<br />NOTE: While we have introduced an update strategy type for coherent, this is still not available.<br />In future releases once this is available this NOTE will be removed.<br /> |
| `RollingRecreate` | RollingRecreateStrategy indicates that replicas will be progressively<br />deleted and recreated one at a time, when templates change. This applies to<br />both pods (for standalone PodCliques) and replicas of PodCliqueScalingGroups.<br />RollingRecreateStrategy qualifies as an auto update strategy in Grove since<br />it handles the orchestration entirely by itself.<br />This is the default update strategy.<br /> |
| `OnDelete` | OnDeleteStrategy indicates that replicas will only be updated when<br />they are manually deleted. Changes to templates do not automatically<br />trigger replica deletions.<br /> |
